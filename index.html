		<a href="http://tappedout.net/">Tappedout</a>. This site allows players to build their decks' and verify that it is legal for their intended game mode. Then the player will de directed to <a href="https://www.frogtown.me/">Frogtown</a> where the newly made decks can be added and all cards are found.
